                <p>If you haven’t noticed, we’re big fans of the tie bar here at GQ. And while we’ve been thrilled to see an
                    uptick in real guys wearing them on the street, we’ve gotta say, some of you just aren’t doing it right.
                    So we asked GQ creative director Jim Moore to break down exactly how it’s done.</p>

                <p>"A well-made tie shouldn't cost a fortune," the Chicago-based retailer The Tie Bar has been bearing this
                    belief in mind since its virtual stores opened in 2004. The pop-up shop featured The Tie Bar's special
                    collection in partnership with NBA superstar Dwyane Wade, including ties, bow ties and pocket squares.</p>

                <p>Jesse Tyler Ferguson may be best known for his role as Mitchell Pritchett on Modern Family, but his interests—and
                    talents—go far beyond acting, delving into the worlds of food, fashion, and philanthropy, and on a recent
                    trip to Chicago, he focused on all three. Ferguson came to the Windy City to host the prestigious James
                    Beard Foundation Awards on May 1 and to celebrate his newest charitable line with The Tie Bar.</p>
